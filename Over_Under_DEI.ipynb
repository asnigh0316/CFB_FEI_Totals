    "For this project, I'm going to look at the totals record for a College Football team in a season and compare their efficiency in a given season. The goal is to compare offensive efficiency to overs, and defensive efficiencies to unders, and see if either of these metrics correlate to one another using regression analysis. Any guesses which one might be more correlated either positively or negatively?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some limitations to this project includes the lack of game-by-game historical data as the total number for individual games are unknown for this aggregated data over each season. An example to illustrate this is a team could go 7-4 on the overs for a season, but have low totals for most games (think low 40s). A concrete example is from the 2022 Illinois team, which had the 3rd best adjusted defensive efficiency. Their over/under record? 8-5 or 61% to the over.... This is also usually the case for when the military academies play each other with totals right around 37 the past few games, and a couple even going over (despite the historical trend of academy unders cashing over 60% of the time). Said another way, the lower a team scores, the lower the bookmakers will make their total line.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see if there's any correlation between strong defenses and unders and strong offenses and overs. Knowing how Vegas operates, there could be a *negative* correlation because oddmakers might see a team perform so well defensively that they move the total for the following week too far in the other direction. With all that in mind let's dig into the stats. First, we must procure our data. Total numbers for the season are compliments of https://www.teamrankings.com/ncf/trends/, which is a great resource for some historic betting information. The efficiency numbers are from https://www.bcftoys.com/2022-fei/ which is also a great open source information for schedule adjusted efficiency stats."

The tricky part here is that because there's so many College Football programs, our joins will only work if the Team name is exact. So in order to combine these we will have to find out from our tables which ones can be combined and cannot. We will do this by performing a right join on both and seeing which Team names remain after the join. Once we have those, we can manually adjust each column. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the list less scary we will subset our data to just the year 2012. We will assume that the different spellings of each name are consistent for each year, thus for sake of simplifying the problem we will start with just year 2012."

    "Overall, these regression results provide information about the significance and relationship between the independent variable (DFEI) and the dependent variable (Under %). The statistically significant coefficient for DFEI suggests that it has a significant effect on the dependent variable. However, the low R-squared value suggests that DFEI alone explains only a small portion of the variation in the dependent variable (6.2%), indicating that other factors may also influence the \"Under %\" outcome."

    "This table gives insights into the goodness of fit, significance of the independent variables, and other diagnostic statistics related to the linear regression model. It helps assess the strength and validity of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables in the regression analysis. The following is a breakdown of some of the different components of this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model: The model used in this analysis is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which is a common method for estimating linear regression coefficients. This method aims to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed points and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. R-squared: The R-squared value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s). In this case, the R-squared value is 0.062, indicating that approximately 6.2% of the variability in the \"Under %\" can be explained by the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adjusted R-squared: The adjusted R-squared value is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of predictors in the model. It penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary variables. In this case, the adjusted R-squared value is also 0.062, which is the same as the R-squared value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. F-statistic: The F-statistic is used to test the overall significance of the model. It measures the ratio of the explained variance to the unexplained variance. A larger F-statistic suggests a more significant relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. Here, the F-statistic is 130.4. To find the significance of our statstics, we need to look at the probabilty associated with the F-stat which is very low (2.73e-29), suggesting that the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable is statisticslly significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Coefficients: The table shows the estimated coefficients for the independent variables. In this case, there are two coefficients: \"Under %\" and \"DFEI\". The \"Under %\" coefficient is 50.3702, and the \"DFEI\" coefficient is 4.8661. The 50.3702 number comes when the DFEI is exactly 0 -- aka an average defensive team will be under their total almost half the time. These coefficients represent the slopes of the regression line and indicate the change in the \"Under %\" for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding other variables constant. For example, say we take an average Defensive team at (0,50.3701), and all else held constant, take a team that's 1 std above average at (1,y). Why is y not defined? Well, if we follow our regression line on our scatterplot, you'll see that by increasing 1 unit, there should be a 4.8661 increase in our y variable, thus, our point should be (1, 55.2363). In other words, teams with a DFEI at or above 1 are projected to be under the game total a little over 55% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Std err: The standard errors associated with the coefficients represent the precision of the coefficient estimates. Lower standard errors indicate more precise estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. t-values: The t-values are calculated by dividing the estimated coefficients by their standard errors. These values are used to test the significance of the coefficients. Here, the t-value for the \"const\" coefficient is 164.760, and for the \"DFEI\" coefficient is 11.420. Both coefficients have p-values less than 0.05, indicating they are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. [0.025, 0.975]: These values represent the 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients. They provide a range within which the true population value of the coefficient is likely to fall with 95% confidence. In other words, most teams in most season would be expected to fall within 49-51%, which is too low to be profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "That section got pretty technical but I think it's important to understand what our regression analysis is demonstrating. The next section, we will see if the top 25% in OFEI and DFEI have any higher correlations compared to our other data."

    "This is more aligned with my thought process going into the project -- that the oddsmakers know when a team has a good offense (top 25%) or defense (top 25%), and they shade the lines accordingly. The public sees these teams on the extreme ends of the equation and figure (team x has a great defense, so they should be holding their opponents to low scores, and thus, more likely for an under). However, this is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The offensive efficiency stats explain a little more for an over than a strong defense and an under (4.6 vs 1.3). This could be due to higher possessions for both teams as the more explosive an offense is, the quicker they'll score, and the more possessions each team will have which would theoretically increase the score. These thoughts are outside the scope of this project, but interesting nevertheless. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our data did show that there's a positive correlation though. Let's see if the bottom 50% of both offensive and defensive efficiency is any more predictive than the top quarter, or the dataset as a whole."

    "Finally, let's look at the bottom half and see if they have a significant inverse effect on the overs and unders. Our technique will be different here because we will pair our low offenses to Unders, and our poor defenses to Overs."
